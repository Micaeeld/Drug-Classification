# Drug Classification
This notebook is a demonstration of how to classify drugs based on their properties using Kaggle's Drug Classification Dataset.

## Context
Drug use can have negative effects on a person's health. It is important to understand what the properties of drugs are and how they can affect the human body to help prevent drug misuse and provide appropriate treatments.

## Goal
The purpose of this notebook is to create a machine learning model capable of classifying a drug based on its properties.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis was taken from Kaggle, an online data science platform that offers public and private datasets, as well as tools for data analysis and modeling. The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification.

## Steps
The following steps will be performed on this notebook:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preparation
- Training a classification model
- Model evaluation

## Results
The model trained on this notebook will be able to classify a drug based on its properties. This can be helpful to better understand drug properties and provide appropriate treatments for patients.
